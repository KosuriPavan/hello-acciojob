# Hello AccioJob

Make a an element using the tag `main`, this tag is used to signify main content of a page. Give that tag a class of `Accio` and id `Job`.
 

 Inside the main element create another element for paragraph giving it a class of `hello-accio-job`.
 It should contain the text `Hello Accio Job` exactly.
 

 This is all we need to do for the styling part.
 

 Using CSS style the main element to have **width** and **height** of `150px` and `black` as **background color**.
 

 Now to solve the issue of paragraph text not visible style the paragraph to have text color `white` and also give it a **margin left of 32px** and **padding of 10px**.
